# Team 4 AWS ETL Project!

### Welcome to our repo!
Established in 2015, Infinity Cafes has rapidly expanded with hundreds of outlets across the country, serving the nation with the daily dose of caffeine they need.
Infinity Cafes approached us because they wanted to enhance their customer experience and increase the efficiency the business through the use of data.
They needed a way to collate, analyse and store the data for each outlet while being able to identify trends. This is where our expertise was required!

We have created an Serverless ETL process where the data is stored into AWS Redshift.
In this repo is the code and files to centralise the whole process for all the cafe outlets. 

Enjoy!
